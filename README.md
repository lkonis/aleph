This is a java code for software that learns hebrew reading
The program is aimed for young kids whos mother-language is hebrew but they don't know read/write
It is best suited for ex-patriate Israelies families

Please respect proprietary code. You are welcome to contribute but don't distribute or use it for any commercial purpose

prerequisites:
be famliar with basic hebrew words

input: mouse+keyboard

output: image, sound

features:
The program starts from most basic level, but it has an implicit state that accumulates achievements
This state allows getting to more complex letters, vowels or words and it is saved at end of each session

There are three phases of training that match young kids understanding and way of thinking
step 1: identify how many sylables in familiar words - no need to know letters but the eyes are getting used to associate written word to a picture
step 2: attach hebrew vowels (nikud) to a given word (aided with image) - no need to know letters, but again they appear on screen
step 3: words are given under pictures, letters are spread randomally on screen and need to be assembled correctly
step 4: words (from same 'word bank') are not shown. only picture is given and word has to be assembled

The user has many hints - e.g. clicking on image will pronounce letter, vowel or sound

collecting points will give a prize, i.e. a small brick game that allows the brain to rest
